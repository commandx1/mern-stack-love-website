# mern-stack-love-website

The mern stack website I developed to use with my girlfriend and practice for react. Frontend was developed with create-react-app and backend with node.js. Database mongo db. The application has been deployed on heroku. Amazon web service S3 was used to store image files. You can update the .env files with your own information and use the codes. You will see empty image tags in some places as I remove private photos. Sorry for this image pollution :)

npm install

npm start
